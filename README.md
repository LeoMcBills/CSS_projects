# CSS_projects

Put some styling to a website using CSS. 
This repository is intended to hold my personal read-ahead content for CSS even before reaching the topic with alx.
The projects saved in this repo are intended to be made more interactive and functioning with JavaScript a topic that I shall learn in the future. Meanwhile, incase there is an eye-catching piece of work, please feel free to contribute some work. Thank you.
